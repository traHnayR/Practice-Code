    <h2>The Hors d'oeuvres</h2>

    <p>Our mental health is very important, it is what makes us function at 100%.
      They're a great deal of many who have excellent <p></p> mental health yet their is 
      an even greater deal of many who have declining mental health. Those who are<p></p>
      spiriling go therapists, take perscriptions, yet those may not work. In fact
      they make you feel even more loss, scared<p></p>and even cause addiction which is not fair. So the 
      question is What can? Well I know, though it may seem a bit odd<p></p> and unique
      but it can work. Instead of the Utilization of therapists, perscriptions, etc,
      the utilization of toys could be<p></p> the solution. Many are overwhelmed from experience
      of being an adult, so why not feel like a child again? That is the<p></p> main purpose of 
      "Project Cavort" to see the neurological impacts from the utilization of play therapy.
